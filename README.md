## Abstract:

When an employee at any company starts work, they first need to obtain the computer access necessary to fulfill their role. It is often the case that employees figure out the access they need as they encounter roadblocks during their daily work. A supervisor then must take time out of his busy schedule to manually grant the needed access. As employees move throughout a company, this access discovery/recovery cycle wastes a nontrivial amount of time and money, which we as a team are trying to reduce.
There is a considerable amount of data regarding an employeeâ€™s role within an organization and the resources to which they have access. Given the data related to current employees and their provisioned access, models can be built that automatically determine access privileges as employees enter and leave roles within a company. These auto-access models seek to minimize the human involvement required to grant or revoke employee access.


## Objective:

The objective of this project is to build a physical database storing details and values of the various hyperparameters generated through running the dataset into H2O. Finally, this database would help support a website which would help data enthusiasts get the best hyperparameter values for their respective datasets
